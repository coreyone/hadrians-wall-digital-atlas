WALLCAST — HADRIAN’S WALL IMMERSIVE AUDIO SYSTEM
Pre-Generated, Multi-Voice, Offline-First
Tone Inspiration: Mary Beard × David Breeze (Wall scholar) × Niall Ferguson × Tristan Hughes × Dan Snow

────────────────────────────────────────
🎧 CONTENT & NARRATIVE REQUIREMENTS
────────────────────────────────────────

1. The system shall generate one ~30-minute episode per defined 3-hour hiking segment (Carlisle → Corbridge alignment).

2. The system shall generate 45–60-minute “Major Site Specials” for marquee locations (e.g., Housesteads, Vindolanda, Birdoswald, Chesters).

3. The narrative voice shall emulate a roundtable dynamic as if Mary Beard, David Breeze, Niall Ferguson, Tristan Hughes, and Dan Snow were co-hosting.

4. The tonal blend shall include:
   - Mary Beard-style myth-busting clarity and cultural texture
   - David Breeze-level archaeological specificity on the Wall
   - Niall Ferguson macro-historical framing (empire, economics, power)
   - Tristan Hughes energetic site-level storytelling
   - Dan Snow immersive battlefield/landscape visualization

5. Episodes shall include intelligent disagreement, interpretive nuance, and historiographical perspective shifts (no monotone narration).

6. Scripts shall avoid modern slang, anachronisms, and dramatized fiction beyond evidence-supported reconstruction.

7. Each episode shall follow a structured arc:
   Cold open → Strategic context → Human lived experience → Archaeology → Landscape interpretation → Reflection.

8. Scripts shall explicitly reference only curated source documents (Wikipedia extracts + heritage summaries + optional academic notes).

9. The LLM prompt shall prohibit fabrication and enforce evidence-based storytelling.

10. Each 30-minute episode shall target 4,500–5,500 words; specials 7,000–9,000 words.

────────────────────────────────────────
🎙️ MULTI-VOICE DESIGN
────────────────────────────────────────

11. The system shall support at least four distinct voice profiles representing:
    - Scholarly analytical voice
    - Archaeological field expert
    - Energetic presenter
    - Macro-historical strategist

12. Dialogue structure shall allow interjections, counterpoints, and clarifying questions between hosts.

13. The TTS layer shall assign consistent voice identities per “historian persona.”

14. Voice tone shall be natural, warm, and documentary-grade (no robotic cadence).

15. Audio shall be normalized, mixed, and mastered to consistent loudness standards for outdoor playback.

────────────────────────────────────────
📍 GPS & EXPERIENCE LOGIC
────────────────────────────────────────

16. The app shall suggest the relevant 30-minute segment episode upon entering a new trail segment and moving < 4 mph.

17. The app shall surface Major Site Specials within ~250 meters of designated heritage sites.

18. Episodes shall require explicit tap-to-play; no autoplay.

19. Completed episodes shall not re-trigger within 24 hours.

────────────────────────────────────────
📦 OFFLINE & DELIVERY
────────────────────────────────────────

20. Users shall be able to download all segment episodes as a pre-hike “Trail Audio Pack.”

21. Playback shall function fully offline, including lock-screen controls and background audio support.

────────────────────────────────────────
⚙️ PIPELINE & OPERATIONS
────────────────────────────────────────

22. The system shall provide a one-command CLI pipeline to regenerate all scripts and audio assets.

23. All scripts and audio files shall be versioned and traceable to their source materials.

24. Voice assignments shall be configurable without rewriting scripts.

25. The generation pipeline shall separate:
    Source ingestion → Script generation → Dialogue structuring → TTS rendering → Audio merge → Export.

────────────────────────────────────────
🎯 QUALITY & DIFFERENTIATION
────────────────────────────────────────

26. Episodes shall prioritize intellectual rigor over dramatization.

27. The system shall balance micro-level archaeological detail with macro-level imperial analysis.

28. Episodes shall include explicit “what to notice as you walk” segments tied to physical landscape cues.

29. Narrative pacing shall accommodate outdoor listening conditions (wind, fatigue, pauses).

30. The overall experience shall feel like walking the Wall with a panel of top-tier historians debating in real time, not listening to a generic audio guide.
