description: 29 essential sections, components, and optimal techniques for developing high-converting landing pages.
---

## 🌟 The North Star
People buy when **effort is low** and **certainty is high**. Every page must answer, fast:
1. **What is this?** (Clarity over cleverness)
2. **Is it for me?** (Ideal user + use cases)
3. **What will it cost?** (Price truth + total cost)
4. **What happens next?** (Clear steps + control)

### 🎨 Backgrounds & Visual Depth

Create an atmosphere rather than defaulting to solid colors.

* **Textures**: Use gradient meshes, noise textures, and grain overlays to add depth.
* **Forms**: Incorporate geometric patterns or layered transparencies that match the tone.
* **Shadows**: Use dramatic or multi-layered shadows to establish hierarchy.

### 🦸 Hero

The first big section on a website that tells you what the site is about, like the cover of a book.
