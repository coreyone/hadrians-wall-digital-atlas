# PRINCIPLE I: STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY (The Architecture of Writing)
## The Paragraph as the Unit
1.  Make the paragraph the unit of composition.
2.  Adhere to a suitable design and hold to it.
3.  Foresee or determine the shape of what is to come and pursue that shape.
4.  Use single paragraphs for brief descriptions, book reviews, or single ideas.
5.  Divide subjects of significant extent into topics, treating each in a separate paragraph.
6.  Begin each paragraph with a sentence that suggests the topic or aids transition.
7.  End paragraphs with a signal that a new step in development has been reached.
8.  In dialogue, start a new paragraph with each change of speaker.
9.  Avoid writing single sentences as paragraphs unless they are transitional.
10. Break long paragraphs in two to provide visual help to the reader.
11. Avoid firing off many short paragraphs in quick succession to prevent distraction.
12. Use moderation and a sense of order as the main considerations in paragraphing.

## Sentence Construction
13. Do not break sentences in two; do not use periods for commas.
14. Avoid a succession of loose sentences consisting of two clauses.
15. Replace monotonous loose sentences with simple sentences or those joined by semicolons.
16. Use the active voice; it is more direct and vigorous than the passive.
17. Put statements in positive form; avoid noncommittal language.
18. Use the word "not" for denial or antithesis, never for evasion.
19. Express coordinate ideas in similar form (parallel construction).
20. Repeat an article or preposition before each term in a series or only before the first.
21. Keep related words together to show their relationship.
22. Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end.
23. Place the subject of a sentence at the beginning for emphasis only if it is also the predicate.
24. Avoid separating the subject and principal verb by a phrase that can be moved.
25. Place the relative pronoun immediately after its antecedent.
26. If an antecedent is a group of words, place the relative at the end of the group.
27. Place modifiers next to the words they modify.
28. In summaries, keep to one tense.
29. Use the present tense when summarizing the action of a drama.

# PRINCIPLE II: ECONOMY & BREVITY (The Removal of Noise)
## Omission of the Superfluous
30. Vigorous writing is concise.
31. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words.
32. A paragraph should contain no unnecessary sentences.
33. Make every word tell.
34. Revise the expression "the fact that" out of every sentence.
35. Eliminate "who is" and "which was" when they are superfluous.
36. Simplify "the question as to whether" to "whether".
37. Simplify "there is no doubt but that" to "no doubt" or "doubtless".
38. Simplify "used for fuel purposes" to "used for fuel".
39. Simplify "in a hasty manner" to "hastily".
40. Simplify "this is a subject that" to "this subject".
41. Simplify "his strange story" instead of "his story is a strange one".
42. Avoid the expression "the reason why is that"; use "because".
43. Combine a series of short sentences into one complex sentence to avoid wordiness.
44. Do not overstate; it causes the reader to lose confidence.
45. Avoid the use of qualifiers like "rather," "very," "little," and "pretty".
46. Do not affect a breezy manner; it often indicates emptiness.
47. Do not explain too much in dialogue tags.
48. Avoid fancy words; do not be tempted by a twenty-dollar word when a ten-center will do.
49. Do not take shortcuts at the cost of clarity.
50. Avoid foreign languages unless convenient or necessary.

# PRINCIPLE III: CLARITY & PRECISION (The Transfer of Meaning)
## Specificity
51. Use definite, specific, concrete language.
52. Prefer the specific to the general.
53. Prefer the definite to the vague.
54. Prefer the concrete to the abstract.

56. Report the details that matter.

62. Use figures of speech sparingly.
63. Do not mix metaphors.
64. Write out names of organizations fully before using initials.
65. Prefer the standard to the offbeat.
66. Avoid the language of advertising and mutilation of standard English.
67. Be suspicious of business vocabulary (e.g., "finalize").
68. Write with nouns and verbs, not adjectives and adverbs.

## Ambiguity Avoidance
69. Ensure "this" refers clearly to a specific antecedent, not a general idea.
70. Distinguish "farther" (distance) from "further" (time/quantity).
71. Distinguish "imply" (suggest) from "infer" (deduce).
72. Distinguish "anticipate" from "expect".

74. Distinguish "less" (quantity) from "fewer" (number).
75. Distinguish "tortuous" (winding) from "torturous" (painful).
76. Distinguish "verbal" (word for word) from "oral" (spoken).
77. Restrict "while" to "during the time that" to avoid ambiguity with "although" or "and".
78. Avoid using "thanking you in advance".
79. Do not use "they" with distributive expressions like "each" or "every one".

# PRINCIPLE IV: MECHANICS & SYNTAX (The Rules of the Road)
## Punctuation
80. Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding 's.
81. Follow the possessive rule whatever the final consonant (e.g., Charles's).
82. Exceptions to possessive: ancient proper names in -es, -is (e.g., Jesus').
83. Pronominal possessives (hers, its, theirs, yours, ours) have no apostrophe.
84. Indefinite pronouns use the apostrophe to show possession (one's rights).
85. Do not confuse "it's" (it is) with "its" (possessive).
86. In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last (serial comma).
87. Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas.
88. Never omit one comma and leave the other in a parenthetic expression.
89. Place a comma before a conjunction introducing an independent clause.
90. Do not join independent clauses with a comma (comma splice).
91. Use a semicolon to join independent clauses not joined by a conjunction.
92. Use a semicolon if the second clause is preceded by an adverb like "accordingly".
93. Use a colon after an independent clause to introduce a list, appositive, or amplification.
94. A colon should not separate a verb from its complement or a preposition from its object.
95. Use a dash to set off an abrupt break or interruption.
96. Use a dash to announce a long appositive or summary.
97. Use a dash only when a more common mark of punctuation is inadequate.
98. Do not use a hyphen between words that can be written as one word.
99. Use a hyphen when two or more words are combined to form a compound adjective.
100. Punctuate parenthetical sentences within parentheses exactly as if they stood alone, omitting the final stop unless it is a question/exclamation.
101. Place the comma inside quotation marks.
102. Place the colon outside quotation marks.
103. Do not use quotation marks for colloquialisms; simply use the word.

## Grammar & Agreement
104. The number of the subject determines the number of the verb.
105. Words intervening between subject and verb do not affect the number of the verb.
106. Use a singular verb after "each," "either," "everyone," "everybody," "neither," "nobody," "someone".
107. With "none," use singular when it means "no one"; use plural when it suggests more than one.
108. A compound subject joined by "and" almost always requires a plural verb.
109. A singular subject remains singular even if connected to other nouns by "with," "as well as," etc..
110. A linking verb agrees with the number of its subject.
111. "The contents" of a book is singular; "contents" of a jar can be plural.
112. Use the proper case of pronoun (subject vs. object).
113. A pronoun in a comparison is nominative if it is the subject of an understood verb (e.g., "better than I").
114. Use the simple personal pronoun as a subject, not "myself" or "yourself".
115. Gerunds usually require the possessive case (e.g., "my asking").
116. A present participle as a verbal takes the objective case.
117. A participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject.
118. Avoid dangling participles.
119. In formal writing, use "shall" for the first person, "will" for second/third (future tense).
120. "Will" in the first person expresses determination or consent.
