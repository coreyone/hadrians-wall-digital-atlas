---

### 🗺️ Layout & Navigation

* Place key actions and value props above the fold.
* Align elements to a consistent grid for visual flow.
* Limit primary nav items to 5–7 choices.
* Use clear, descriptive labels in menus.
* Keep your logo linked to home in the same spot.
* Highlight the current page in your nav.

### 🔍 Scanning & Visual Hierarchy

* Design in an “F” or “Z” scanning pattern.
* Use size, weight, and color to show importance.
* Break content with headings, subheadings, and bullets where natural. 
* Limit body text lines to 50–75 characters.
* Set body font ≥16 px and line-height 1.4–1.6×.
* Reserve bold/color for true emphasis.

### 📄 Content & Copy

* Write scannable sentences and short paragraphs.
* Use chunking: group related ideas under clear headers.
* Lead with your core value proposition.
* Use simple, familiar words—not jargon.
* Add microcopy to guide next steps.
* Preview link destinations with tooltips or labels.

### 🖋️ Forms & Inputs

* Place labels above fields, aligned left.
* Group related fields with clear boundaries or whitespace.
* Provide inline validation and real-time feedback.
* Pre-fill sensible defaults when possible.
* Use progressive disclosure for long or optional fields.
* Put the primary call-to-action button after the last field.

### ⚡ Feedback & Error Handling

* Show system status (spinners, progress bars) for loading.
* Use clear, polite, action-oriented error messages.
* Offer undo or confirm for destructive actions.

### ♿ Accessibility & Performance

* Ensure text-to-background contrast meets WCAG AA.
* Make touch targets at least 44 × 44 px on mobile.
* Write semantic HTML and use ARIA roles appropriately.
* Optimize images and lazy-load offscreen content.
* Aim for page load < 3 seconds on mobile networks.
* Test keyboard-only navigation and focus order.

Whitespace isn’t empty—generous margins and spacing boost readability by easing cognitive load and speeding eye tracking.
**Key takeaway:** a clear grid plus typographic hierarchy with ample whitespace creates **balance**, **clarity**, and **scannability**.

Below, 25 NN/g–inspired rules for margins, spacing, headline sizing, font sizing, and whitespace.

### 🎯 Margin & Gutter

1. Frame content with ≥10% viewport margins to anchor and protect.
2. Align everything to an 8 px baseline grid for consistent rhythm.
3. Match column gutters to page margins for visual symmetry.
4. Signal new sections with whitespace at least as tall as the page margin.
5. Group form elements with 8 px between label and field, 16–24 px between groups.

### 🖋️ Spacing & Typography

6. Use body text ≥16 px for legibility across devices.
7. Set line height to 1.5–1.75 × font size for smooth reading.
8. Limit line length to 50–75 characters to aid focus.
9. Add 4–8 px tracking on uppercase headlines for glanceability.
10. Reserve all-caps for labels; use sentence case in paragraphs.
11. Stick to two typefaces and consistent weight/italic variants.
12. Space paragraphs by 1.5–2 × line height to group ideas.

### 📏 Headline & Font Sizing

**Markdown-specific rule:**
- Do not use tables in markdown. Instead, use bulleted lists, definition lists, or other scannable alternatives. This greatly improves readability and scannability, especially on mobile and in plain markdown viewers.


13. Establish a modular scale (1.25–1.618 ratio) for harmonious sizing.
14. Make H1 ≥2 × base size, H2 ≈1.5 ×, H3 ≈1.25 × to guide the eye.
15. Limit to three heading sizes—small, medium, large—for clarity.
16. Use 24–32 px for primary headlines; 18–20 px for secondary.
17. Give each heading a top margin of 2 × line height to separate sections.
18. Align headings to the baseline grid for consistent vertical flow.

### ⚖️ Balance & Whitespace

19. Group related items tightly; separate unrelated ones generously.
20. Distribute whitespace symmetrically around focal elements.
21. Leverage the golden ratio for element sizing and gaps.
22. Ensure ≥8 px clear space around buttons and interactive controls.
23. Apply uniform padding inside cards and UI elements for stability.
24. Use a defined spacing scale (4, 8, 16, 24, 32 px) for predictability.
25. Test across breakpoints; tweak margins and font sizes to keep balance.

# Markdown Usability Quick-Guide
> **Key takeaway:** Structure Markdown like a miniature UI—clear hierarchy, tight language, and breathable whitespace turn docs into self-serve support.

## 1. Plan First 🧭
* Keep **one concept per section**.

## 2. Headings as Landmarks 🏷️
* Progress sequentially: `#`, `##`, `###`—never skip a level.
* **Front-load keywords** for search clarity.
* Cap length ≈ 60 chars.

## 3. Bite-Sized Paragraphs Unless Otherwise Specified
* 2–3 lines max.

## 4. Lists for Flow 📋
* **Bullets** → parallel ideas.
* **Numbers** → ordered steps.
* One sentence per bullet.
* Indent sub-lists by **two spaces**.

## 5. Emphasis, Sparingly 🔍
* **Bold** for importance.
* *Italics* for nuance.
* Never style whole paragraphs.

## 6. Descriptive Links 🔗
* Write meaningful anchors: `[Install guide]`, not “here”.
* Add optional titles: `[API docs](url "v2.3")`.
* Prefer relative links inside repos.

## 8. Let It Breathe 🌬️
* One blank line between blocks.
* Trim trailing whitespace.

**So What?** Clear, scannable Markdown slashes confusion and repeat questions—freeing you to build instead of explain.


Key Style Pillars 
1. Typography-Led Design
Primary Font:Elegant, high contrast, often large and center-aligned
Secondary Font: Used for body copy, nav, labels — modest and clean
Typography is the hero — large headers, lots of whitespace, precise tracking
Embrace large type sizes for emotion and impact — hero headers should command space.

3. Use Editorial Layouts
Build with a modular, grid-based layout — lots of whitespace, visual rhythm, and breathing room. Center-align key content in hero sections and stack vertically on mobile. Big type, small captions. Mobile-first stacking.
Often structured like a magazine: wide gutters, generous margins. Use generous padding and margins (24–48px) — spacing is branding. Section blocks breathe — nothing cramped.

3. Use Deliberate Motion animations
Use subtle, elegant transitions — 0.2–0.3s ease-in-out fades or scaling. Never flashy. Micro-interactions only. Scroll reveals, slight fades. Smooth.
