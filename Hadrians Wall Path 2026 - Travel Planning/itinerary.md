> [!TIP]
> **Trail vs. Road "Truth Check"**: 
> Google Maps estimates ~45 miles and 16.5 hours for this route using the direct B6318 "Military Road." The **National Trail Path** in this itinerary follows the archaeological remains and landscape, which adds roughly **15-20% more distance** (~52 total trail miles) and significantly more vertical effort. Your itinerary's pacing (4-5 hours walking/day) is the correct standard for the actual Trail experience.

## Timing Anchors (Mid/Late April)
- Plan for **sunset around 20:15-20:35** in mid/late April.
- Plan to be **off the trail by 16:30-17:00** so you can stop for a pint, check in, shower, and still make dinner before kitchens close.
- "Last orders" and alcohol service hours **vary by premises licence**, so always confirm the pub's posted hours.
- Daily pacing target: **4-5 hours walking**, plus **60-90 minutes** for Roman sites, plus **60 minutes** for a relaxed lunch or pint.
- Bus or taxi shortcuts add **waiting time**, so check same-day timetables before you leave.
