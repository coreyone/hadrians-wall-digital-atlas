## Main Airports (Best Gateways)
- **Newcastle International (NCL)**: Closest, simplest for the eastern trailhead at Wallsend and for Newcastle's pre/post-walk city time. Metro connects the airport to the city centre in ~25 minutes.  
  Learn more: [Newcastle Airport Metro info](https://www.newcastleairport.com/preparing-for-travel/getting-here/by-metro/).
- **Manchester (MAN)**: Bigger international hub; longer ground transfer but good for transatlantic options.
- **Edinburgh (EDI)**: A strong international gateway. The ground transfer to Carlisle is often **faster and less stressful** than from London.
- **London (LHR/LGW/LTN/STN)**: Most flights from the U.S. land here; plan for same-day rail north or a London overnight if arrival is late.

## Flight Notes (Likely Airlines)
- **United** and **Virgin Atlantic** both operate transatlantic service into **London Heathrow (LHR)**. Check your origin city schedules, as routes and timings are seasonal.

## Train Spine (Best Long-Distance Option)
- **London King's Cross -> Newcastle**: Direct trains run frequently; typical journey is about **3 hours**.  
  Learn more: [LNER direct service](https://www.lner.co.uk/routes/london-kings-cross-to-newcastle-trains/are-there-direct-trains-from-london-kings-cross-to-newcastle/).
- **London Euston -> Carlisle**: Direct trains; fastest journeys are about **3h 17m**, average closer to **4 hours**.

- **Newcastle -> Carlisle (Tyne Valley Line)**: Direct trains, around **1h 30m** on average.  
  Learn more: [Tyne Valley Line journey times](https://www.scotrail.co.uk/train-times/newcastle-to-carlisle).

## Heathrow (LHR) -> Carlisle (Arrival Options)
You can land at **LHR between 7:25 am and 2:00 pm** and still reach Carlisle the same day. The main decision is how much transfer time you want in London.

**Option A: Fast rail via Paddington + Euston**
- **Heathrow Express** to **Paddington** (about **15 minutes**).  
  Learn more: [Heathrow Express journey time](https://www.heathrowexpress.com/the-route/journey-time).
- **Tube or taxi** from Paddington to **Euston** (allow 20-30 minutes).
- **Avanti West Coast** from **London Euston -> Carlisle** (**3h 17m** fastest).  
  Learn more: [Avanti West Coast London-Carlisle](https://www.avantiwestcoast.co.uk/travel-information/train-times/london-euston/carlisle).

**Option B: Value rail via Elizabeth line + Euston**
- **Elizabeth line** from Heathrow to **Paddington** (about **28 minutes**).  
  Learn more: [Elizabeth line Heathrow info](https://rms.tfl.gov.uk/modes/elizabeth-line/getting-to-and-from-heathrow-on-the-elizabeth-line).
- Transfer to **Euston**, then **Avanti** to Carlisle (as above).

**Option C: Simpler but slower via Piccadilly line**
- **Piccadilly line** to central London (about **49 minutes**), then onward to Euston.  
  Learn more: [Heathrow Express timetable info](https://www.heathrowexpress.com/timetable).

**Practical tip for your arrival window**
- If you land **before noon**, same-day Carlisle is usually comfortable.  
- If you land **after 1:00 pm**, consider a **London overnight** to keep the first hiking day easy and avoid late arrivals.

## The Edinburgh Shortcut (LHO Alternative)
If you want to avoid the "Great London Transfer," flying into **Edinburgh (EDI)** and taking the train south is a brilliant hack for reaching Carlisle.

**Step 1: Edinburgh Airport -> Waverley Station**
- **Airlink 100 Bus**: Direct to Waverley Bridge (30 mins, ~£5.50). 24/7 service.
- **Tram**: To St Andrew Square (35 mins, ~£7.90). Every 7 minutes.
- Learn more: [Edinburgh Airport Transport](https://www.edinburghairport.com/transport).

**Step 2: Edinburgh Waverley -> Carlisle**
- **Train**: Direct trains (Avanti West Coast or TransPennine Express) run frequently.
- **Journey Time**: Approximately **1h 15m**.
- Learn more: [Avanti West Coast Edinburgh-Carlisle](https://www.avantiwestcoast.co.uk/travel-information/train-times/edinburgh-waverley/carlisle).

**Practical tip for the "Shortcut"**
- While there are no direct flights from SFO to EDI, a single connection in London, Amsterdam, or Dublin is often worth it to land in a smaller, more manageable airport closer to your starting point.

## Corbridge -> Heathrow (Departure Options)
Corbridge sits on the **Tyne Valley Line**, which links **Newcastle** and **Carlisle**.  
Learn more: [Tyne Valley Line overview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyne_Valley_line), [Corbridge station](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/corbridge/).

**Option A: Corbridge -> Carlisle -> London Euston -> Heathrow**
- Local train to **Carlisle**, then **Avanti** to **London Euston**.  
  Learn more: [Avanti West Coast London-Carlisle](https://www.avantiwestcoast.co.uk/travel-information/train-times/london-euston/carlisle).
- Transfer to **Heathrow** via Heathrow Express or Elizabeth line.

**Option B: Corbridge -> Newcastle -> London -> Heathrow**
- Local train to **Newcastle**, then a mainline service to **London King's Cross**, then onward to Heathrow.

**Practical tip for your return window**
- If your flight **departs before 1:00 pm**, plan a **London/Heathrow overnight** the night before.
- For **mid/late afternoon flights**, a very early start from Corbridge can work, but build in a **3+ hour airport buffer**.

## Arrival Timing: Where to Sleep First Night
- If you land late in the UK, **sleep near a rail hub** so you can start fresh in the morning.
- Best staging town: **Newcastle** (easy Metro to Wallsend, plenty of late-night food).
- Best staging town: **Carlisle** (easy bus links to Bowness, compact and walkable).

## Departure Timing: Best Exit Strategy
- If you finish at **Bowness**, it's usually easiest to **return to Carlisle** by bus and then train onward.
