## Top Themes That Directly Matter To You

- **Pub and dinner timing matters** in villages with limited hours.
- **Comfortable lodging is common**, but some stays are off-trail or basic in Bowness/Solway.
- **Weather and wind are real**; several reviews recommend walking **west-to-east** to reduce headwinds.

## Pacing Guidance From Reviews (Optimized for 4-5 Hours Walking)
These notes are consistent across many reviews and align with your desired pace:
- **6-8 days minimum** is a common recommendation to avoid long, exhausting days. Several reviewers felt **5-day itineraries are too hard**.
- **Day 3 and Day 4 are the hardest** (central Wall section, repeated climbs/descents). Reviewers consistently call these days "long" or "strenuous."
- **Start early** on days with Roman sites. Reviewers say you need extra time for forts and museums.
- **Build one lighter day** for Roman sites (Vindolanda + Roman Army Museum). Many reviewers say they ran out of time without a buffer.
- **A rest day is worth it** if you want Roman time, pubs, and a relaxed pace.

## Segment-Specific Notes From Reviews
These map cleanly to your itinerary days:
- **Wallsend -> Newcastle (arrival day add-on)**: multiple reviews recommend walking this short stretch on Day 0 so Day 1 is easier and less pavement-heavy.
- **Solway to Carlisle**: several reviews found this segment less interesting and suggested **bus/taxiing** part of it if short on time.
- **Chollerford -> Once Brewed**: repeatedly flagged as **harder than expected** with constant ups/downs.
- **Housesteads area**: cafe and toilets are **down a steep slope** from the Wall, which adds time and effort.

## Practical Hacks and Micro-Tips (Direct From Reviews)
These are small but real tips that came up in reviews:
- **Passport stamp**: The Bowness-on-Solway stamp was reported stolen; reviewers said to get a stamp at the **King's Arms Pub**.
- **Laundry**: Twice Brewed Inn was praised for **cheap laundry** (one reviewer: 5 pounds).
- **Pub meals**: If the inn offers to cook (Lanercost and similar), **take it**; options can be scarce.
- **Lunch timing**: One review suggests stopping for lunch after about **two-thirds of the day** when energy starts to dip.
- **Extra day at Once Brewed**: multiple reviews say this is the best way to visit Vindolanda without skipping trail miles.
- **Start early on fort-heavy days** to avoid running out of daylight.
- **Check weekday closures** in small towns (Gilsland lunch closures were a problem for one group).
- **Bring a sleep mask** if sensitive to light (some rooms had thin curtains).
- **Heddon area**: one reviewer warned a popular Wall section is slightly off-path and easy to miss.
- **Toilets**: a few reviews mention long stretches without toilets or bushes, so plan stops.

## Alignment With Your Preferences (Corey)
Based on the reviews, your best-fit approach is:
- **9-10 days** is the sweet spot for 4-5 hour walks plus Roman sites and pint stops.
- **Include a lighter museum day** (Vindolanda + Roman Army Museum) so you do not skip history.
- **Stay in towns with real pub dinners** (Hexham, Corbridge, Once Brewed, Carlisle) and book meals on small-village nights.
- **Avoid hostels**: reviews show B&Bs and inns are the norm and are generally comfortable.
- **Plan for off-trail lodging** with taxi options, and keep a small cash buffer.

## Suggested Edits To Keep In Mind (If You Want Me To Update `itinerary.md`)
- Add a note on **west-to-east** direction for wind.
- Add a **museum buffer day** at Once Brewed.
- Flag **Chollerford -> Once Brewed** as the most strenuous day.
- Add **pub booking** note for Once/Twice Brewed nights.
- Add **Sunday transport caution** around Wark on Tyne.
