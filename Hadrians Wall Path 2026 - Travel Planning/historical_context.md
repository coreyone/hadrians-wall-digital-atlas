## 1) Before the Romans: Ancient North (Pre-43 CE)
Long before Rome showed up, this landscape was shaped by **Iron Age communities** and tribal networks. The north was a frontier even then - rugged, windy, and strategically important.
- What you can feel today: **ancient hillfort terrain** and the idea of a natural defensive frontier.
- A nearby echo: **the Brigantes**, a major Celtic tribal confederation in northern Britain.

## 2) Rome Arrives (43-122 CE)
Rome invades Britain in 43 CE and slowly pushes north. By the early 2nd century, the empire decides it needs a **fixed frontier** - enter **Hadrian's Wall**.
- The Wall was built from **122 CE** and stretches across northern England.

- Today's best Roman "origin" site: **Segedunum (Wallsend)** - the eastern terminus fort.

## 3) Life on the Frontier (2nd-4th centuries CE)
The Wall wasn't just a barrier. It was a **living military zone** with forts, milecastles, supply routes, and civilians.
- **Vindolanda** preserves daily life on the frontier - letters, boots, and artifacts that feel wildly personal.

- **Housesteads**, **Chesters**, and **Birdoswald** show different fort layouts and daily routines.

## 4) Rome Withdraws (5th century)
As the Roman Empire pulls back, the Wall's garrisons fade. Forts are reused, raided, or repurposed by later communities.
- What you see now: **stone foundations, earthworks, and a landscape shaped by reuse** over centuries.

## 5) Northumbria & Early Medieval (7th-11th centuries)
This region becomes part of **Anglo-Saxon Northumbria**, a powerhouse of early medieval culture.
- A nearby cultural anchor: **Holy Island (Lindisfarne)**, tied to early English Christianity.

## 6) Borderlands & Reivers (13th-16th centuries)
The Anglo-Scottish border made this a **contested, violent zone** - castles, tower houses, and border raids shaped daily life.
- Suggested add-on: **Carlisle Castle**, a key border fortress.

## 7) Industrial North (18th-20th centuries)
Coal, shipping, and industry transformed the Tyne and adjacent regions.
