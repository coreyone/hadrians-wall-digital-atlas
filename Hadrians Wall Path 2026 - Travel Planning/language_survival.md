# Language Survival Guide (Hadrian's Wall Path)
## Document Goals
- This document is a language cheat sheet for travelers.
- It includes a list of phrases in the local language and their English translations with phonetic guides.
- It focuses on words that sound similar to English words so they are easier to remember.
- It focuses on international words that Americans already use.
- It uses slang and words used by locals instead of academic language.
- Sections include Quick Common Words (greetings, this/that, yes/no, water, bread, coffee, wine, cheese, excuse me, thank you), introducing oneself, ordering at a restaurant (food, drink, bill, cash/credit card payment), and numbers (for shopping).
- It includes a ONE-WORD survival list - if one were to travel the entire country saying only 1 word at a time, these would be the most helpful easy-to-use words.
- It includes a section on the reality of language in the destination: percent who speak English and the phrases to know to be polite.

English is the working language everywhere you'll be, but the **local flavor** is part of the fun. This is a practical, memory-friendly cheat sheet with local slang and simple phrases that feel natural in Northumberland, Tyneside, and Cumbria.

## Reality Check: Who Speaks English?
